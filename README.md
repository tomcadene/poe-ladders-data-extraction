# poe-ladders-data-extraction
A collection of scripts used to extract data from the Path of Exile ladders

I do recommend using different chrome profiles for each script if you are running several scripts at the same time

# Scripts
* ðŸ•µ `find_account_characters.py`
  * The script will navigate to the specified POE leaderbaord page, find, print and log an account characters. Every X seconds the script will reload the page and repeat the process.
* ðŸ’¾ `save_ladder_data.py`
  * The script will navigate to the specified POE leaderbaord page, find, print, log and save all the ladder characters in a json file. Every X seconds the script will reload the page and repeat the process.
* `save_new_characters.py`
  * The script will navigate to the specified POE leaderbaord page, find, print, log and save all the characters and new characters in a json file. Every X seconds the script will reload the page and repeat the process.
